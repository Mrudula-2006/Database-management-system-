Task 4- Using Functions in queries and writing subqueries:            
Aim: Perform the advanced query processing and test its heuristics using the designing of 
optimal correlated and nested subqueries such as finding summary statistics. 
Procedures: 
Queries:  
A query is a request to retrieve specific data from a database. It's a way to ask the database 
for specific information, and the database returns the results in a structured format. 
Syntax: 
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE condition; 
1. The SELECT * statement requests that all columns (id, name, country, and age) be 
returned for the matching rows. 
2. The FROM clause specifies the table to query, which is customers. 
3. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the country column 
is equal to 'USA 
Subqueries: 
❖ A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is known as the main 
query, and the inner query is known as a subquery. 
❖ Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator. 
❖ A subquery is enclosed in parentheses. 
❖ In the Subquery, ORDER BY command cannot be used. But GROUP BY command 
can be used to perform the same function as ORDER BY command.
