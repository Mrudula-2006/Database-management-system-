Task 5    
Implementation of different types of Joins 
Aim:  To Perform the advanced query processing and test its heuristics using the designing of 
optimizing complex queries and their equivalence queries. 
Procedures: 
SQL JOIN 
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column 
between them. 
Types of JOIN 
1. Simple Join 
1. Equi-join : 
2. NonEqui-join : 
2. Self-Join Query 
3. Outer Join 
1. Inner Join 
2. Left Outer Join 
3. Right Outer Join 
4. Full Outer Join 
The join is actually performed by the ‘where’ clause which combines specified rows of tables. 
Simple Join: 
It is the most common type of join. It retrieves the rows from 2 tables having a common columnOuter Join: 
▪ It extends the result of a simple join. An outer join returns all the rows returned by 
simplejoin as well as those rows from one table that do not match any row from the table.  
▪ The symbol(+) represents outer join. 
Outer Join 
• Inner Join 
• Left Join 
• Right Join 
• Full Outer Join 
• (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables 
• LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records
